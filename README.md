# byu_scripts
Scripts used to interact with BYU Webpages
This was a script I wrote up quickly to check my sisters BYU application for her.  It just checks to see if the field next to the BYU Provo has changed from "Completed" to (hopefully!) "Admitted", and will email a gmail account when updated.
You'll need to set up a cron job to run this on whatever interval you want.

It's pretty custom to this one use.  It would need a tweak for BYU Hawaii/Idaho, or for other status changes. If you want some additional features let me know and I'll see what I can do for ya.
